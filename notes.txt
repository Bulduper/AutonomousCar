sensor modes correspond to resolution
sensor mode 0 seems to show full spectrum of camera, but we dont need such  high resolution (3264 x 2464)
sensor mode 3 seems similar but is 4x less pixels (1640 x 1232)

To get rid of the pink overlay around the center use the method from this link https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/IMX219-160_Camera


----CALIBRATION-----
To rectify an img in OpenCV we need to take at least 30 pictures of chessboard at different angles.
https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.15/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html
The flow is:

cv2.findChessBoardCorners => cv2.cornerSubPix (optional, only for drawing )=> cv2.calibrateCamera => matrices, coefficients etc. [SAVE RESULTS]
=> cv2.getOptimalNewCameraMatrix (makes it possible to see the whole img after the undist. - with black fields (alpha = 1))=> cv2.undistort

Using the ROI (region of insterest) returned by cv2.getOptimalNewCameraMatrix we can crop the image.
Probalby using cv2.getOptimalNewCameraMatrix makes no sense unless we want the whole 
(very strange looking) img or we want use different resolution, than the one used for calibration.
